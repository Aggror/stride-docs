# Packaging

## Introduction

Since 3.1, Xenko is using NuGet format to pack and reference not only the code libraries, but also Xenko assets.

As a result, you can:
- [Create a NuGet package](create-packages.md) out of your project to share your Xenko assets.
- [Consume a NuGet package](consume-packages.md) by simply referencing it. You can then use its Xenko assets.
